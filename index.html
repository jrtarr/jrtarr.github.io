			<h2>The Problem</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="contentBlock">
			<p>College can be a constant struggle for many students. Between classes, work, social lives, and even just getting sleep, there are many places in their lives where students feel they could be more successful. We wanted to design an app or website that could help students reach the success they strived for and help them in their daily lives.</p>

			<h3>Interviews</h3>
			<img src="images/interviewDemo.png" id="interviewChart" alt="Chart of Interview Demographics">
			<p>Our first step in designing our product was learning more about how students defined success and what struggles they faced in achieving it. We interviewed 13 students of varying classes, genders, and other demographics in hopes of getting many different definitions of success.</p>
